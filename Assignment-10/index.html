    <center><h1>Acquainted with the Night</h1>
<h2>By ROBERT FROST<h2><center>
<div class="text ">
<p>I have been one acquainted with the night.
I have walked out in rainâ€”and back in rain.
I have outwalked the furthest city light.</p>
<p>
I have looked down the saddest city lane.
I have passed by the watchman on his beat
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.</p>
<p>
I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
When far away an interrupted cry
Came over houses from another street,

But not to call me back or say good-bye;
And further still at an unearthly height,
One luminary clock against the sky

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.
I have been one acquainted with the night.</p>
</div>
